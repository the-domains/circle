  Winner of a VCU Design Contest. A proud day in my life during my last year
  attending VCU. I feel I captured an image of VCU's Career Services that anyone
  can relate to and even wear. I believe this is a testament to my ability to
  understand what a client is looking for and effectively use the best tools to
  accomplish it. I am very happy with the designs and so pleased I got to
  positively impact the school and students for years to come.

Winner of a VCU Design Contest. A proud day in my life during my last year attending VCU. I feel I captured an image of VCU's Career Services that anyone can relate to and even wear. I believe this is a testament to my ability to understand what a client is looking for and effectively use the best tools to accomplish it. I am very happy with the designs and so pleased I got to positively impact the school and students for years to come.

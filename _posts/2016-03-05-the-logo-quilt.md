Most of my logo design work ranges from $60-$100 depending on what we need to make happen.

The logos I create are a product of knowing and understanding you and your goals. I make a great effort to give you a logo suite that fits your needs and/or fits the mission of your organization...

As I continue to create logos, I add them together to make these "quilts." I like the way quilts tell different stories all while being in one visual design. These logo quilts don't have everything I've done, but I'm working to get a few more quilts put together.

A strong web presence can be important, but some just don't know where to start. Once we meet or chat, I will get to know your needs. Once I know your needs I can create all the content and manage your website for you.

With the right tools and knowledge you can do just about anything. I can point you in the best direction for your website and even build it for you. If you are looking for something completely custom, I can make some recommendations. I utilize web based platforms to create and build your website. I have the tools and I have the knowledge.

Websites I have built...

[TrailerHookPal.com][0] A revolutionary product needs a revolutionary website. Using Square Space, I was able to put together a clean and easy to use commerce site that has perfect SEO. This start up company is now making sales across the nation and continues to grow.

[Richmond2015HOPE.com][1] The HOPE initiative included over 1,000 volunteers named, HOPE Ambassadors. The organization needed to market to the faith community and churches to gather volunteers as well as show the city of Richmond & Richmond2015.com the positive impact there will be if the organization is supported by them. The logo with different languages and a promotional video was created by Innovative Faith Resources, and local news stations ran multiple stories of the HOPE Initiative.

September 19-27, 2015 Richmond, VA was the host city of the 2015 UCI Road World Championships. This is an international event where the city had guests from 75 nations & 450,000 fans. The Richmond faith community joined together to welcome the participants and spectators of the race to give hospitality, help and hope. As a weekend cyclist I gladly offered my services to assist the organization. My work includes the website, social media, web graphics, & print consulting.

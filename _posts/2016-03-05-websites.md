With the right tools and knowledge you can do just about anything. I can point you in the best direction for your website and even build it for you. If you are looking for something completely custom, I can make some recommendations to get things started. I prefer to utilize web based platforms to create and build your website. This way I can Handle the fine details and nerdy work I love to do while you still have access to everything.

Here are some websites with content I've created and manage... A tip: You should click the links because then you get to see all the hard work I love to do!

* [Premier League Wallpapers][0] I am a major fan of English Football and soccer. This website is a beautiful combination of my graphic design passion and sports. \#COYI \#WHUFC

* [The Post Revolution][1] A design project to influence more attractive and effective social media campaigns.

* [TheHookPal.com][2] A revolutionary product needs a revolutionary website. Using Squarespace, I was able to put together a clean and easy to use commerce site that has all the analytic tools a small business owner could use. This start up company is now making sales across the nation and continues to grow.
* [TashaKing.net][3] "Love, laughter and life." Working with Tasha is a huge pleasure and I am so glad I got to build her website. Tasha is a play-write, comedian, author, minister, fitness instructor and all around great person to be around. Also using Squarespace, I am able to manage content while if need be we can collaborate and work together.
* [Richmond2015HOPE.com][4] (No longer active) The HOPE initiative included over 1,000 volunteers named, HOPE Ambassadors. The organization needed to market to the faith community and churches to gather volunteers as well as show the city of Richmond & Richmond2015 . com the positive impact there will be if the organization is supported by them. The logo with different languages and a promotional video was created by Innovative Faith Resources, and local news stations ran multiple stories of the HOPE Initiative. September 19-27, 2015 Richmond, VA was the host city of the 2015 UCI Road World Championships. This is an international event where the city had guests from 75 nations & 450,000 fans. The Richmond faith community joined together to welcome the participants and spectators of the race to give hospitality, help and hope. As a weekend cyclist I gladly offered my services to assist the organization. My work includes the website, social media, web graphics, & print consulting.

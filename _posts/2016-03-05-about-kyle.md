A few things I understand:

\#1 Every morning I wake up, I know it is a blessing from the Lord and because of that I will make the day more worthy of living than the last.

\#2 Each day is an opportunity to better my skills. I do not get involved in something unless I know I can grow & learn from it.

\#3 Every opportunity is a responsibility to achieve success. Whatever success may mean at the moment, I intend to see it through.

Why You Should Update Your Resume Every Year - Author: Kyle Carline
![How to define your goals and work a happy life.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e1f483e8-f953-49c3-963b-07739c4f5b35.jpg)

It makes sense to update your resume before you apply for a job, but you should also update your resume even if you already have your job. The resume is a tool used to outline your interests and experiences. Great resumes accomplish describing a person's past by not only listing employment but by providing a sense of personality, equally unique as the experiences. Visually striking and interactive resumes are unforgettable when compared to a traditional, word processed curriculum vitae. However, _you_ are creating _your_ resume, you should built it from self-examination and reflection on who you are and what you want to do.

Keeping your CV up-to-date doesn't just make the job application process easier, it is a way for you to get to know yourself better. When building your resume think about more than just the jobs you have done in the past. Consider the things you have learned and how you have grown from those experiences. If you don't think you have grown from your experiences, then make that obvious to yourself. Perhaps now is the time to get a job that you can learn and grow from. Ask yourself questions to help yourself verbalize what you intend to do with your future. Prepare your mindset to be reflective and begin to outline in words what your goals are.

> Having a self-less, servant's attitude will get you further in your career than merely doing your job and clocking out. 

Often applying for a job is stressful, and finding ways to make yourself look like the best fit adds to the anxiety. Stress free job applying involves being prepared and confident in yourself to accomplish your goals. Some employers only care to see a list of your previous jobs on your resume, so it may help you prepare to have a paragraph cover letter written out beforehand. The cover letter is for you to remember what you would like to say, but also if the employer or HR cares to read it then you can stand out a little more. Prepare an updated cover letter for each job or position you are interested in. There is no better way to have your resume ready to go, than when you know you already have it updated from a few months back.

Updating your resume doesn't mean you should be constantly applying for new jobs. If you are doing well and comfortable at your current job then you should probably stay. Applying for other jobs may also send mixed signals to your co-workers and supervisors. If your goal is to grow within your current position or company, then having open and candid conversations with your supervisors could be a good way to start updating your resume with a specific focus on your organization. It's a rough world out there and some people are uncomfortable with change, so tread lightly, use your manners, and don't change your job for the wrong reasons.

Your resume involves effort and if you are willing to work hard for the rewards of knowing you are doing your work to best of your ability, you will find updating it is an easy and worthy task. You might just find that when you update your resume, you have done some pretty great things and are quite happy with where you are in life. If you don't want to update your resume or write cover letters or even if you don't want to remember you read this article, I have advice for you. Be a servant above being an employee. Having a self-less, servant's attitude will get you further in your career than merely doing your job and clocking out. Work hard, find your goals, meet them, celebrate and remember that you didn't do it for yourself, but you did it to serve those around you.

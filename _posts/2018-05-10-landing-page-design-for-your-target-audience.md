# Landing Page Design For Your Target Audience

## How to conquer designs that convert

A landing page doesn't have to look good, to perform well. If there is to be anything you can remember from this article, it should be that looks don't matter as much as you think...

There are a few relative assumptions in the phrase, "A landing page doesn't have to look good, to perform well." This article will break down two major points in that phrase and address how any marketer can build a designed experience for their landing pages to perform best.

We won't technically be focused on where your users are coming from or what stage of the funnel they are in. This is about how your page _looks_ and how you _think_ about landing page design. At this point you have all the items and data ready and you should use all the knowledge in your arsenal to build your page.

Let's talk about how you will arrange your data, words, images, and everything else on your page.

You may have found yourself surprised because you thought your landing page had everything it needed and then it ended up leaving you confused as to why people weren't converting. The following will help you take a step in the shoes of your audience to get your page looking its best.

The first assumption to tackle is determining what looks good. Many factors are at play when someone decides what looks good versus what looks bad. The quickest way to make that decision is to ask yourself, "would my audience think this looks good?"

For example, let's say we are working on a name acquisition campaign for The Backstreet Boys. The goal is to get people signed up to receive a newsletter with the incentive to win a free poster. You have your images and/or video for the page, the form fields decided, a footer with all the legalese, and some body copy that the band's label has requested be used.

So now what? Can we just pile all of these things the client has given us, stacks-on-stacks into the landing page? Maybe...but first ask yourself what you think the audience would like. If you're feeling stumped take inspiration from the images provided.

* What colors are there?
* What does the font look like? Serif, or sans-serif?
* Do any colors stand out to you? Use those as accents, like red for the form button.

In my honest opinion I think this landing page is ugly. But it doesn't matter what I think, it matters what the audience thinks. It has everything they need to convert, a catching title, informative copy, and a very obvious form.

Things to point out in the example page:

* There are no stock images used. You might think you need an image of some random happy fan crying with a poster in hand. If you have actual imagery of your subject, go with that. In this case we are using real poster images. (Alternatively you could A/B test a page with stock photos used.)
* There is legible space between text, images, and objects. Don't place too many images near each other and don't squish titles with body copy. Give things room to flow.
* There is no top menu to distract away from the goal. The user can basically do one thing and that is submit the form or leave.

The second assumption to clarify is performance. Campaigns come in all shapes and sizes, therefore it will change how performance is judged.

When it comes to judging your page's performance you are likely to turn to whatever your ROI is, or compare it to a similar page and campaign. But we are strictly looking at design experience here. You could boost your conversion rate 5% just by changing the color of your form button!

The reality is that you may encounter clients and pages with all sorts of different needs and you may think that everything they require is wrong and will look terrible...

<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxtzk8LwiAYgPGvIu99GSOiQoU69OcWFMSO5t6p4KZTa9Snb6xT0PmBHw-zTZQtkhQVB5NzSBtKtQ3mNVO-pdjesaZVNuX71uO17rceyGDrbDgsVnMgBq02mUO5XAOZqJ2PNUYOY1ROpsRh4oqJAiKd88P-4dxFRcROMPo9ECwIJomJ2Pwb0bZJdIi-08XvjXhaSQ6n87FiVI5aEB_cIkfG" height="350" style=""></iframe>

But it could really be the best thing for the target audience. Some offers and products require much more information for users to feel confident to convert.

Form fields are often regarded as the biggest factor that affect conversion rates. The more fields (first name, last name, email, mailing address, etc) you require, the less conversions you will get. There are tricks you can employ, like [multi-step forms][0] to make life easier for a user.

Don't get caught up in thinking that your page isn't converting enough because it doesn't have a progress scroll bar, text animations, or objects made by a real-life graphic designer. Your measure of success should be based on making sure you have given the user everything they need to know, and then displayed that in a comfortable way.

So go and look at your landing page. Did you give the audience everything they need? Did you answer any possible questions they may have? If you missed something, then your page is _not_ performing well.

Pages (and clients) can get complicated and you do have to pay close attention to a lot of different things when building a page, even more than what is covered in this article. But if you have to produce some less-than-tasteful LP designs, use the facts and your best judgement. Have no fear as long as the page design is catered to fit the needs of the target audience.

Many organizations require multiple types of marketing and I can provide guidance and application to accomplish goals. I believe that my passion and expertise in graphic design and web communication is an avenue to serve others. For this reason, I am more than happy to collaborate with large businesses, small organizations or individuals who have ideas they want to see in print, a website that needs touch-up, refreshed logos or some posters for an event. I am an artist with professional experience in communications and I am ready to help out any way I can.
